 Repository from test to conquer a job in Data Sprints

# This is a project with the objective of Exploratory Data Analysis 
The DataBase for this project are datas from taxi trips in the New York city in 2009 to 2012 years.

To this code run perfectly, it's easier run it in Anaconda Jupyter Notebook, because it comes with the necessary packages
The only package that you will need install is the Folium. --The command to install is in the first cell from notebook.

Files
   -- There are five files needed to run the code, and two is already in the folder 'dataFiles'
      ----
      data-vendor_lookup-csv.csv
      data-payment_lookup-csv.csv
      ----
      The others, you will need download. (The link of files is in the 'dataFiles/files_address.txt')
      
   -- And, of course, you will need run the 'data_sprint_test.ipynb' file.

To Run

   -- If all .json and .csv files are in the folder 'dataFiles', you can now run the .ipynb file. Cell by Cell
   
   The firts cell is only to install folium package. Isn't necessary run this cell after first time.
   
   In the next, are made all imports, and test if all files are in the folder. If you don't download all of them, a error will be displayed.
   
   Thenceforth, all cells are a pair of creation functions and the call of them.
   
   In the end of notebook, will be executed to function of maps, using the Folium package.
   My computer not is a greate PC, so, I put only 1,000 lines of trips (equal 2,000 markers)
   If your PC is best, send the entire DataFrame

The Charts
   The MatPlotLib is so big, with an incredible amount of bealtiful charts. 
   I choiced some that show best way the datas.
   You can try others forms. You are free :)
