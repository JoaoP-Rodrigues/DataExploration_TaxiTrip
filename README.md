To this code run perfectly, it's easier run it in Anaconda Jupyter Notebook, because it comes with the necessary packages
The only package that you will need install is the Folium. --The command to install is in the first cell from notebook.

Files
   -- There are six files needed to run the code, and two is already in the folder 'dataFiles'
      ----
      data-vendor_lookup-csv.csv
      data-payment_lookup-csv.csv
      ----
      The others, you will need download. (The link of files is in the 'dataFiles/files_address.txt')
      This file aren't in correct JSON format, so, you will need add one bracket in start and other in end of file, besides inserting a comma in each line final.
      
   -- And, of course, you will need run the 'data_cab_trip.ipynb' file.

To Run

   -- If all .json and .csv files are in the folder 'dataFiles', you can now run the .ipynb file. Cell by Cell
   
   The firts cell is only to install folium package. Isn't necessary run this cell after first time.
   
   In the next, are made all imports, and test if all files are in the folder. If you don't download all of them, a error will be displayed.
   
   Thenceforth, all cells are a pair of creation functions and the call of them.
   
   In the end of notebook, will be executed to function of maps, using the Folium package.
   My computer not is a greate PC, so, I put only 1,000 lines of trips (equal 2,000 markers)
   If your PC is a top of the line, send the entire DataFrame. Good luck!
